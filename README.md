# project1 or SF2812
This report covers the first project, part B, assigned by the course SF2812 Applied Linear Optimization. The main assignment is to compute the optimal strategy for Green Destruct on transporting waste material from factories and at which location to destruct it. The linear optimization and stochastic optimization model are calculated by GAMs.
